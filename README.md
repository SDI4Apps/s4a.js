s4a.js is a client-side Javascript library for rapid spatial application development based
on the SDI4Apps OpenAPI GIS server platform

It extends OpenLayers, d3.js and a few other leading Javascript libraries - and provides
users with the parts they need to put spatial functionality into their HTML5 applications

This library is intended for the users who would like to get maps into their applications
without the workload of running a server, installing and maintaining software and learning
the professional concepts of GIS.

## Status
* The first version of the library was released on the 31st of March 2016
* The library is under still under active development and we advise users to check out the develop branch for the latest features
* New releases with incremental functionality are frequent at this stage

## Installation
The library may be installed using Bower

It may also be cloned from this Git repository and built locally using Node
Package Manager. Once downloaded, open a command line utility and navigate to

## Documentation

Once the library has been installed locally and grunt has been run, the documentation
will be available in a sub-folder called 'docs'. Here you can browse the class references
and see how to use the libraries.

## Demos

A couple of demonstrations on how the library may be used can be seen at the home page of the 
template client offered by the SDI4Apps project, namely HSLayers NG.
