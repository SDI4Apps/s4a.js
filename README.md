This library is intended for the users who would like to get maps into their applications
without the workload of running a server, installing and maintaining software and learning
the professional concepts of GIS.

## Status
* The library is under Development
* First public release planned for March 2016

## Funding
The development of s4a.js is part-funded by the European Commission through the SDI4Apps project 2015-2017.
